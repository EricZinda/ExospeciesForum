Q: Hello, very eager to try the game.
Will there be an Android version?
Wishing you the best.

A: Hope to have you in the beta at some point! Next platforms will be PC and Android, currently planned in that order, but nothing is locked in stone. Iâ€™ll count this as a vote for Android! Join the Exospecies facebook, twitter,
