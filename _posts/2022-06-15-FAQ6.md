title: "Why is my unit blocked from moving?"
categories: [FAQ]

Q: My inducer was blocked above ground by a worker under ground. Couldn’t move him out until worker moved. Shouldn’t he be able to move above him?

A: Two things are going on here: You can’t move across cells occupied by your own underground units (you can do it for opponent units, though). Also: when units move they transition between the cells so it temporarily blocks two of them.
